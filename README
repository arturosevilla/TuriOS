TuriOS pretends to be a very simple OS

Right now it only has bootloader which can be installed on a floppy or a floppy
image. The floppy should be formatted with FAT12, it doesn't matter if it
supports VFAT or not.

This project is for educational purposes.

For now just run "make" in the boot directory to get the prepared disk image.
